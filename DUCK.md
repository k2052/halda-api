Items have a Temp

Items all come into a feed. 
Items are unique to a user.

Showing up increases the item's temp by 1.
Adding an item to a collection creates a new CollectionItem and hides it from the feed.

Things will parsed and then sent out as SSEs. Clientside figures out how rto rank and sort things.
